The tech scene in Brisbane has grown considerably over the last several years. But recently, I've been noticing events I want to attend conflicting with each other more and more often.

While this is all just a part of life, I wanted to try and do something to bring this somewhat disparate Brisbane tech community together. To make a place where community events can be found, without having to go searching across multiple Meetups, Eventbrite pages, Facebook groups, and word of mouth channels.

This came to a head late last year during my domain registrars Black Friday sale, when I picked up eventsbne.me for 2 American dollars. As I'm sure any developer will tell you, choosing a domain is the hardest part, so once that was done the rest came easy!

After a few weeks hacking in my free time, this is the result. It's a website that lists all the Brisbane tech events, and I'm hoping to use the platform to curate and promote various community initiatives while promoting diversity in tech.

So, it's a humble start, but I'm hoping with time that we as a community can build on this platform.

## Conflict resolution
Right now, the killer feature for event organisers is the conflict finding tool on the homepage. This is a tool that lets you plug in a date, and see if there are any other events scheduled, to make sure you're not going to double up a booking with other similar events.

This is an itch I've wanted to scratch for ages, and I'm hoping it will mean firstly that and we can cut down on conflicts, but also that event organisers can get in touch and start collaborating more.

## Developing
All the source code is on GitHub, so folks are able to submit pull requests to improve the current features, as well as to help curate and massage the data.

If this model works out, eventually I imagine other cities will be able to take the code, and spin up their own take on the idea in future.

Just a warning though, for the duration of the beta, the back-end infrastructure is going to be running off my laptop.

The static site front end is hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com/), so it will be super snappy for visitors, but it means I can tweak the scrapers and iterate quicker on the back and components while the site is young. So that gives you an idea of the kind of approach I'll be taking on this beta release.

So obviously, don't rely on any of this and data for mission critical applications: self driving cars, nuclear reactors etc. But if you do find a bug you can submit it on the get up issues, the link is in the footer.

## Going forward
I'd really like to build on the event management tools, namely around:

1. finding different types of events that interest you (frontend, backend, women in tech, social meetups etc)
1. scheduling events and building tools for event organizers
1. teaching newbies to code (via courses, meetups, communities etc)
1. giving the tools, skills, and encouraging folks to speak at meetups

So hopefully with time we can make a thing of this. I am super proud of the Brisbane tech community, and I reckon we're only getting better from here.

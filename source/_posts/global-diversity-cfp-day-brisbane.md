Global Diversity CFP Day is a community event based on the successful workshops held in advance of ScotlandCSS and ScotlandJS 2016. The initiative sees communities around the world came together to run workshops to give underrepresented groups the skills they need to speak at conferences.

We had about 18 attendees at the ThoughtWorks Brisbane offices, and everyone was keen and ready to learn!

The open plan layout of the office meant that everyone could split off into groups of mentor & mentees, which made for a really close-knit experience, and lots of time to ask questions.

The program covered a bunch of things from choosing a topic, writing the title & synopsis, putting together a bio, and then running through how to construct a talk.

At the end of the day everyone seemed to be in a really great mood.

It was satisfying chatting to folks and hearing about their genuinely awesome talk ideas, and it was especially great seeing the difference in attitudes as people got more confident in their abilities.

Overall I'm so proud of everyone who attended, and thankful for the global group who put the resources together. It was a great day and now I can't wait to see the attendees present at meetups and conferences!

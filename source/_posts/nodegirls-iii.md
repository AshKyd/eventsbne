description: Community organizing is a tough job, but we've got some awesome folks in the Node community. Here's the story of the team that grew Node Girls Brisbane from the ground up.

In 2017 Anwesha Chatterjee attended a RailsGirls event and loved the idea. Wanting to get into Javascript, she found that the Node Girls movement didn't have a Brisbane chapter so decided to put together a team and start it herself.

[Node Girls](http://nodegirls.com.au/) runs free JavaScript and Node.js workshops for women, non-binary and trans folk around Australia. They run half day coding bootcamps (lunch and snacks provided!) and are also a great opportunity for newbies in the industry to grow their network and meet new people with similar interests.

On Saturday the Brisbane team ran the third workshop for beginner Javascripters, and attracted over 90 attendees to Fishburners Brisbane. This was the largest Brisbane Node Girls event to date, and the atmosphere was full of excitement.

Attendees had time to work through self-paced activities, network amongst themselves, as well as ask questions of the mentors throughout the day and over lunch. It was a great opportunity to learn the basics and has hopefully kickstarted many new career paths in the tech industry.

The Brisbane Node Girls workshop is entirely volunteer-run, and couldn't happen without the hard work of the organizer team (Anwesha Chatterjee, Dana Mison, ArmaÄŸan ErsÃ¶z & Sammy Herbert), as well as the effort put in by the speakers, mentors, and attendees. This event was also sponsored by FishBurners, SixPivot, Just Digital People, and the Queensland Government.
